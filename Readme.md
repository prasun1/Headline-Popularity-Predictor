******GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS AND INFORMATIONS FOR TERMINAL/JUPYTER NOTEBOOK BASED CODE******

The source code includes 'code.py'(can be executed from terminal) file and 'code.ipynb'(Jupyter Notebook file). The required data are kept inside 'dataset' folder which includes following files - 
1. final_news.csv
2. Facebook_Economy.csv
3. Facebook_Microsoft.csv
4. Facebook_Obama.csv
5. Facebook_Palestine.csv

12. LinkedIn_Obama.csv
13. LinkedIn_Palestine.csv
14. test_sentences.csv

All other files are intermediate files generated while executing the code.
